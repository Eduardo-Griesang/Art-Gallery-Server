# Gallery Art backend

This is the API I developed to be the backend of My Art Gallery.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
node app.js
```

This will run the API localy on [http://localhost:8000/art](http://localhost:8000/art) where you can see all the art data stored on the JSON.

## Available HTTP methods

```bash
GET
POST 
PATCH
DELETE
```

You can check out their functionalites by running localy then testing it using [Postman](https://www.postman.com).
Or you can see this functionalites working on live on [My Art Gallery](https://my-art-gallery.vercel.app)
